### Featured Projects

#### 1. Fraud Detection MLOps for Model Deployment and Monitoring (Group Project)
- **Goal:** Designed and deployed an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using an MLOps framework. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, versioning, deployment via FastAPI, and monitoring using MLflow. This project follows CI/CD best practices with GitHub Actions and Docker to ensure scalable, reproducible workflows. 
 
- **Tools:** FastAPI, Docker, MLflow, GitHub Actions, Weights&Biases  
- **Project Repo:** [Fraud Detection MLOPS Pipeline Implementation](https://github.com/KibetuMaureen/ie_mlops_group6)

#### 2. Cycling in Numbers - A Case Study of Cycle Paths in Rhine- Kreis Neuss (Learning Project) 
- **Goal:** This project analyzes bicycle traffic data in the Rhine-Kreis Neuss region, Germany, simulating real-time streaming, batch processing, and predictive analytics. By using big data technologies such as Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, and Hadoop, the system ingests, processes, and visualizes cycling trends to support urban planning and bike-sharing initiatives.

- **Tools:** Apache Kafka, Apache Spark, Hadoop
- Project Repo - [Cycling in Numbers](https://github.com/KibetuMaureen/ie-mda-II-mar25-group10)

#### 3. Energy Price Day Ahead Forecast (Datathon Project)
- **Goal:** Forecast System Price for the UK electricity market on October 1st, 2024, using 30-minute intervals. When working with renewable energy sources that require storage and discharge into the grid, the price forecast can be used to determine and plan for the next day's Battery storage system charging and discharging cycles.
